<h2><small>By GERALD VANCE</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Champ</span>, what's with ya
lately?" Benny asked
the question as they lay on
the beach.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Frankie answered.
"Just fight-nite miseries,
I guess."</p>

<p>"No it ain't, Frankie. It's
something else. You losin' confidence
in Milt? That it? Can't
you hold it one more time?
You guys only need tonite and
you got it. One more to make
Ten-Time Defenders&mdash;the
first in the game, Frankie."</p>

<p>"We won the last two on
points, Benny. Points&mdash;and
I'm better than that. I keep
waiting, and waiting, for my
heels to set; for Milt to send
it up my legs and back and let
fly. But he won't do it,
Benny."</p>

<p>"Look, Champ, Milt knows
what he's doing. He's sending
you right. You think maybe
you know as much as Milt?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I just do, Benny.
Maybe I do."</p>

<p>Benny didn't have the answer
to this heresy. By law
this was Frankie's last fight&mdash;as
a fighter. If he won this
one and became a Ten-Time
Defender he would have his
pick of the youngsters at the
Boxing College, just as Milt
had chosen him fifteen years
before. For fifteen years he'd
never thrown a punch of his
own in a fight ring.</p>

<p>Maybe because it was his
last fight in the ring he felt
the way he did today. He understood,
of course, why fighters
were mentally controlled
by proved veterans. By the
time a fighter had any real
experience and know-how in
the old days, his body was
shot. Now the best bodies and
the best brains were teamed
by mental control.</p>

<p>Benny had an answer now.
"Champ, I think it's a good
thing this is your last fight.
You know too much. After
this one you'll have a good
strong boy of your own and
you can try some of this stuff
you've been learning. Milt
knows you're no kid anymore.
That's why he has to be careful
with you."</p>

<p>"I still have it, Benny. My
speed, my punch, my timing&mdash;all
good. There were a dozen
times in those last two
fights I could have crossed a
right and gone home early."</p>

<p>"Two times, Frankie. Just
two times. And them late in
the fight. Milt didn't think
you had it, and I don't think
you did either."</p>

<hr />

<p>Milt, Frankie's master control,
came down to the beach
and strolled over to join them.
Milt had been a Five-Time Defender
in the Welter division
before his fights ran out. Now
he was skinny and sixty. His
was the mind that had directed
every punch Frankie had
ever thrown.</p>

<p>He studied the figure of
Frankie lying on the sand.
The two-hundred-pound fighting
machine was thirty years
old. Milt winced when he
compared it to that of the
twenty-two-year-old slugger
they would have to meet in a
few hours.</p>

<p>Benny said "Hi," and ambled
off.</p>

<p>"Well, boy, this one means
a lot to both of us," Milt said.</p>

<p>"Sure," was all Frankie
could answer.</p>

<p>"For you, the first Ten-Time
Defender the heavyweight
division has ever produced.
For me, The Hall of
Boxing Fame."</p>

<p>"You want that pretty bad,
don't you, Milt?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess I do,
Frankie, but not bad enough
to win it the wrong way."</p>

<p>Frankie's head jerked up.
"What do you mean, the
wrong way?"</p>

<p>Milt scowled and looked as
though he wished he hadn't
said that. He turned his head
and stared hard at his fighter.
"There's something we
maybe ought to have talked
about, Frankie."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>Milt struggled for words.
"It's just&mdash;oh, hell! Forget it.
Just forget I said anything."</p>

<p>"You figure we win tonight?"</p>

<p>"I think maybe we will."</p>

<p>"You don't seem very sure.
On points, huh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, maybe on points."
Milt turned his eyes back on
Frankie's eager face. "Frankie,
boy&mdash;there's something
about being a Ten-Time Defender
that's, well&mdash;different."</p>

<p>Milt took a deep breath and
was evidently ready to tell
Frankie exactly what he
meant. But Frankie broke in,
his voice low and tense.
"Milt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"When I get in there tonight&mdash;turn
me loose!"</p>

<p>Milt was startled at the
words. "Release <i>control</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;sure. I think I can
take Nappy Gordon on my
own!"</p>

<p>"Nappy can stick his fist
through a brick wall&mdash;all
night long. And Pop Monroe
knows all there is to know and
some he makes up himself.
They'd be a tough pair to
beat. Our big ace is that they
have to beat us. We <i>got</i> the
Nine-Times."</p>

<p>"I can take him, Milt!"</p>

<p>There was a strange light
in Milt's eyes. He did not
speak and Frankie went on.
"Just one round, Milt! If I
slip you can grab control
again."</p>

<p>"You just want a try at it,
huh?"</p>

<p>There seemed to be disappointment
in Milt's voice;
something Frankie couldn't
understand. Milt seemed suddenly
nervous, ill-at-ease. But
Frankie was too eager to give
it much attention. "How
about it, Milt&mdash;huh?"</p>

<p>Milt had been squatting on
the sand. He got to his feet
and looked out across the
water. "All right. Maybe we'll
try it."</p>

<p>He seemed sad as he walked
away. Frankie, occupied with
his own elation, didn't notice ...</p>

<hr />

<p>In the studio dressing
room, a few hours later Milt
and Frankie were warming
up. Frankie in the practice
ring and Milt perched on a
high chair just outside the
ropes.</p>

<p>Everything was just as it
would be in the fight. Three
minutes work, one minute
rest. Frankie noticed how
slowly and carefully Milt was
working him, and how he
watched the clock.</p>

<p>Frankie had nothing to do
now but watch, as a spectator
would; watch as Milt moved
him around. Milt could control
every muscle, every move
and every reflex of his body.
It had taken them five years
to perfect this routine. That
was the training period at the
College of Boxing, and was
prescribed by law.</p>

<p>In their first fight they had
been at their peak. Frankie
was Milt's second boy and
Milt knew boxing as only a
Champion Welter with thirty
years of experience could
know it. For fifteen years he
had watched and studied
while a good veteran had directed
his body. And for another
fifteen years he had
been the guiding brain to a
fine Middleweight.</p>

<p>As a Welterweight, Milt
had learned to depend on
speed and quick hands. In
Frankie he had found the
dream of every Welter&mdash;a
punch. Frankie's body could
really deliver the power. At
first, it had been the heavy
hitting that had won the
fights; lately, Milt had relied
more and more on the speed
and deception he had developed
in Frankie.</p>

<hr />

<p>Frankie felt the control
ease out and knew the warm-up
was over. He slipped on
his robe and he and Milt went
to join the others in the TV
studio.</p>

<p>There would be no crowd.
Just the cameras, the crews
and officials. The fight would
be televised in 3-D and filmed
in slow motion. If a decision
were needed to determine the
winner, it would be given only
after a careful study had been
made of the films.</p>

<p>There was little to be done
in the studio and Milt had
timed Frankie's warm-up
right to the minute. The fighters
and their controllers took
their positions: the controllers
seated in high chairs on
opposite sides of the ring; the
fighters in opposite corners.</p>

<p>As the warning buzzer
sounded, Frankie felt Milt
take control. This one he
would watch closely.</p>

<p>At the bell Frankie rose
and moved out slowly. He noticed
how relaxed, almost
limp, Milt was keeping him.
There was only a little more
effort used than in the pre-fight
warm-up. His left hand
had extra speed but only
enough power to command
respect. The pattern was just
about as he had expected. As
the fight went along the left
would add up the points. But
his thoughts were centered on
a single question. <i>How is it
going to be on my own?</i></p>

<p>In the early rounds he was
amazed at the extreme caution
Milt was employing.
Nappy Gordon's face was beginning
to redden from the
continual massage of Frankie's
brisk left and occasional
right. But Frankie felt that
his own face must be getting
flushed with eagerness. The
glory of going in and trying
to do it by himself; of beating
Pop Monroe without
Milt's help. He wondered if
Milt would have to clamp on
the controls again. He sure
hoped not. But there wasn't
anything to really worry
about. Milt could beat Pop
Monroe and he wouldn't let
Frankie take a beating by
himself.</p>

<p>Frankie's attention was
caught by some odd thoughts
in Milt's mind. Milt didn't
seem to be sending them, yet
they were clear and direct:
<i>You really think you've got it,
boy? That vital ingredient?</i></p>

<p><i>What you talking about?</i></p>

<p><i>Huh? Me? Oh, nothing.
Take it easy.</i> But Milt's
thoughts were troubled.</p>

<p><i>When you going to let me
go?</i></p>

<p><i>I said, take it easy. We'll
see.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>The sixth round came and
Frankie felt no weariness.
Milt was working him like he
was made of fragile glass.
Nor was Nappy tiring so far
as he could notice. Pop Monroe
was trying for just one
solid blow to slow down the
Champ. So far nothing even
jarring had come close to
landing.</p>

<p>In the seventh Frankie noticed
a little desperation in
Monroe's tactics. To win now
Monroe and Gordon needed a
knockout. Frankie had only to
stay on his feet to be home
safe. But when was Milt going
to let him go? Milt had
turned in a masterpiece of
defensive fighting. The left
had deadly accuracy and now
the openings were truck-sized
as Monroe had come to ignore
the light tattoo of the
Champ's punches.</p>

<p>Milt withdrew the control
in the middle of the seventh
round. It hit Frankie like a
dash of cold water, the exultation
of being on his own!
He looked over at Milt, perched
rope-high in his control
chair at ringside. Milt was
looking at him, his face tight
and grim; almost hostile.</p>

<p>Frankie circled warily, a
touch of panic coming unbidden.
What to do? He hadn't
known it would be quite
like this. He tried to remember
how it was&mdash;how it felt
to move in the various ways
Milt always sent him. Funny
how you could forget such
things. The left hook&mdash;that
jab&mdash;how did they go?</p>

<p>A pile driver came from
somewhere and almost tore
his head off his shoulders ...</p>

<p>He was looking up at the
ceiling. He rolled his eyes and
saw Pop Monroe's face&mdash;smiling
a little, but also puzzled.
Even with his brain
groggy, Frankie knew why.
He'd stepped wide open in
Nappy's looping right and
Pop couldn't figure Milt doing
a thing like that.</p>

<p>Pop looked over at Milt.
Frankie followed Pop's eyes
and saw the look Milt returned.
Then the spark of understanding
that passed between
them. Odd, Frankie thought.
What understanding could
there be?</p>

<p>He was aware of the word
seven filling the studio as the
loud speaker blared the count.
He was up at nine.</p>

<p>Nappy swarmed in now.
Frankie felt the pain of hard,
solid blows on his body as he
tried to tie up this dynamo
Poppy Monroe was releasing
on him. He couldn't stop it,
dodge it, or hide from it.</p>

<p>But he finally got away
from it&mdash;staggering. Nappy
came at him fast and the left
jab Frankie sent out to put
him off balance didn't even
slow the fury a bit. Frankie
took to the ropes to make
Nappy shorten his punches.
It helped some, but not
enough. No man could take
the jolting effect of those ripping
punches and keep his
feet under him. Frankie didn't&mdash;he
was down when the
bell ended round nine.</p>

<hr />

<p>In his corner the seconds
worked quickly. He looked at
Milt and saw a dead-pan expression.
Milt wasn't sending
him anything. Punishing him
of course. Frankie took it
meekly; ashamed of himself.
Milt would take over again
when the bell sounded. Frankie
knew that he couldn't stay
away from Nappy for another
round. Nobody could. Monroe
smelled a knockout and
Frankie was never fast
enough to run away from the
burst of viciousness that
would come at him in the
form of Nappy Gordon. No,
Milt would take over.</p>

<p>At the bell, Frankie moved
out fast, waiting for the familiar
feel of Milt expertly
manipulating his arms and
legs and body; sending out the
jabs and punches; weaving
him in and out.</p>

<p>But Milt didn't take over
and Pop sent Nappy in with
a pile-driver right that
smashed Frankie to the floor.
Frankie rolled over on his
knees and shook his head
groggily, trying to understand.
Why hadn't Milt taken
over? What was Milt trying
to do to him?</p>

<p>Milt's cold face waved into
focus before Frankie's blinking
eyes. <i>What was Milt trying
to do?</i> Frankie heard the
tolling count&mdash;six, seven,
eight. Milt wasn't even going
to help him up. Sick and bewildered,
Frankie struggled
to his feet. Nappy came driving
in. Frankie back-pedalled
and took the vicious right
cross while rolling away.
Thus he avoided being knocked
out and was only floored
for another eight-count.</p>

<p><i>Milt&mdash;Milt&mdash;for God's
sake&mdash;</i></p>

<p>The round was over.
Frankie staggered, sick, to
his corner and slumped down.
The handlers worked over
him. He looked at Milt. But
Milt neither sent nor returned
his gaze. Milt sat looking
grimly off into space and
seemed older and wearier
than time itself.</p>

<p>Then Frankie knew. Milt
had sold him out!</p>

<p>The shocking truth stunned
him even more than Nappy's
punches. Milt had sold him
out! There had been rare
cases of such things. When
money meant more than honor
to a veteran. But Milt!</p>

<p>Numbed, Frankie pondered
the ghastly thought. After all,
Milt was old. Old men needed
money for their later years.
But how could he? How could
he do it?</p>

<p>Suddenly Frankie hated.
He hated Nappy and Pop and
every one of the millions of
people looking silently on
around the world. But most
of all, he hated Milt. It was a
weird, sickening thing, that
hatred. But only a mentally
sickening thing. Physically, it
seemed to make Frankie
stronger, because when the
bell rang and he got up and
walked into a straight right,
it didn't hurt at all.</p>

<p>He realized he was on the
floor; the gong was sounding;
he was getting up, moving in
again. There was blood, a
ringing in his head.</p>

<p>But above all, a rage to kill.
To kill.</p>

<hr />

<p>He remembered going down
several times and getting up.
Not caring how he had swung
under Milt's control&mdash;only
wanting to use his fists&mdash;to
kill the thing weaving in
front of him.</p>

<p>Nappy. A grinning, weaving,
lethal ghost.</p>

<p>He felt a pain in his right
fist and saw Nappy go down.
He saw Pop's face go gray
as though the old man himself
had felt the force of the
blow. Saw Nappy climb erect
slowly. He grinned through
blood. Frankie&mdash;ghost-catcher.
He had to get him.</p>

<p>He was happy; happy with
a new fierceness he had never
before known. The lust of battle
was strong within him and
when Pop weaved Nappy desperately,
Frankie laughed,
waited, measured Nappy.</p>

<p>And smashed him down
with a single jarring right.</p>

<p>The bell tolled ten. Pop got
wearily off his stool and walked
away. Frankie strode
grimly to his corner, ignored
Milt, moved on into the dressing
room.</p>

<p>He knew Milt would come
and he waited for him, sitting
there coldly on the edge of the
table. Milt walked in the door
and stood quietly.</p>

<p>"You sold me out," Frankie
said.</p>

<p>There was open pride in
Milt's eyes. "Sure&mdash;you had
to think that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, think?
You didn't pick me up when
Pop flattened me. I saw the
look between you and Pop."</p>

<p>"Sure." Milt's eyes were
still proud. "You had to know.
That's how I wanted it."</p>

<p>"Milt&mdash;why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do it. I just had to
make you think I did."</p>

<p>"In God's name&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm sentimental,
maybe, but I've always had
my own ideas about the kind
of fighter who should be a
Ten-Time winner. All my life
I've kept remembering the old
greats&mdash;Dempsey, Sullivan,
Corbett&mdash;the men who did it
on their own, and I wanted
you to get it right&mdash;on your
own&mdash;like a real champion."</p>

<p>Frankie was confused. "I
wanted to go on my own. Why
didn't you tell me then?"</p>

<p>"Then you'd have lost.
You'd have gone down whimpering
and moaning. You see,
Frankie, all those old fighters
had a vital ingredient&mdash;the
thing it takes to make a champion&mdash;courage."</p>

<p>"And you didn't think I had
it?"</p>

<p>"Sure I did. But the killer
instinct is dead in fighters
today and it has to be ignited.
It needs a trigger, so that was
what I gave you&mdash;a trigger."</p>

<p>Frankie understood. "You
wanted me to get mad!"</p>

<p>"To do it, you had to get
mad&mdash;at me. You're not conditioned
to get mad at Nappy
or Pop. It's not the way we
fight now. It had to be me. I
had to make you hate me."</p>

<p>Frankie marveled. "So
when Pop looked at you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He knew."</p>

<p>Frankie was off the table,
his arms around Milt. "I'm&mdash;I'm
so ashamed."</p>

<p>Milt grinned. "No, you're
not. You're happier than you
ever were in your life. You're
a real champion. Great feeling,
isn't it? Now you know
how <i>they</i> felt&mdash;in the old
days."</p>

<p>Frankie was crying. "You
are damn right! Thanks."</p>

<p>Milt looked years younger.
"Don't mention it&mdash;<i>champ</i>."</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
